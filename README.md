# admin-dashboard
Project built as an intern at ESDS software solutions

The admin-dashboard was implemented to display the JSON data from calls to the openstack-swift API.
The app home page calls 2 different components, the header component and the sidebar component.
The sidebar component has different tabs for different commands in the openstack swift recon command list.
Each tab calls a different component/s and displays data in forms of graphs, tables or on card components.

The project admin-dashboard was created using node.js and react.js frameworks mainly.
Additionally react-chartjs2 was used to make charts.
React material UI provides components such as tabs, cards and papers that were used to style the react pages.
